## 🧠 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) & Neuroscience

I’m working on a research project focused on **rehabilitating comatose patients** using **SSVEP-BCI (Steady-State Visual Evoked Potential)** and **EEG** signal processing.

- 👁️ Visual & audio stimulus for emotional reawakening in coma patients
- 🧠 EEG data acquisition & analysis with **Brainstorm**
- 📊 Progress tracking with **Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)**
- 🧠 AI-based emotional recovery system under development
- 🏥 Collaborating with hospitals for real patient datasets
- 🎯 Goal: Build a personalized, machine-learning-driven coma rehabilitation system

## 🌐 Web Development Projects

### 🛒 Flask-Based E-Commerce Platform

- 🔧 Built with **Flask**, **Flask-Admin**, **Flask-Security**, **SQLite/SQLAlchemy**
- 🎨 Consistent UI using **Kanit font** and **responsive layout**
- 🔐 Admin login secured using **Flask-Security-Too**
- 🖼️ Dynamic product pages with multiple image support using **Jinja2 templates**
- 🚀 Deployed on **Render.com (free tier)**

### 📚 University Library System (Java + JSP)

- 💻 Tech Stack: **Java**, **Servlets**, **JSP**, **JDBC**, **MySQL**, **Apache Tomcat**, **Eclipse IDE**
- 🧩 Features:
  - User registration & login
  - Searchable book database
  - Backend connected via JDBC
  - Admin page for managing books and users
- 🔍 Shifted architecture from pure JSP to **Servlet-backed JSP** pages for scalability

### 🔐 Password Strength Checker

## 🛡️ Privacy & Digital Ethics

I'm building an **interactive online privacy assessment tool** that:

- ✅ Analyzes user behavior: browser, VPN usage, privacy settings, etc.
- 🧠 Delivers **personalized security & privacy recommendations**
- 🎯 Goal: Empower users with actionable insights, not just scores

## 💻 Java & CS Fundamentals (In Progress)

Pursuing a deep, theory-first understanding of computer science and Java:

- ☕ Java internals: **JVM**, **GC**, **Bytecode flow**
- 🧵 Threading, concurrency, and object lifecycle
- 🧮 University-grade **data structures & algorithms**
- 🏗️ Developing full-stack apps using Java-based architectures

---

## 🔌 Hardware, IoT & Open Source Projects

- 🔋 Experience with **Arduino Nano**, transitioning to **ESP** and **ESP32 Xiao S3**
- 🧱 Exploring bitmap vs. vector-based rendering techniques
- 🧪 Designing failure-resistant, open-source IoT workflows
